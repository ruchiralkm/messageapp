# Real-Time Messaging Application(Snap Line)

Developed a full-stack messaging application using React.js and Firebase to enable real-time communication between users. The app includes features such as user authentication, real-time chat functionality and seamless file uploads.

For data storage and user management, I utilized Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication, while media uploads are handled through Firebase Storage. The project also focuses on providing a responsive UI, using React.js and framer motion animations for an engaging user experience.

Technologies Used
On the front-end, I implemented React.js, CSS, Framer Motion for animations and React Toastify for notifications. The back-end relies on Firebase, including Firestore for data management, Authentication for user security, and Storage for media handling.

Tools
I used Firebase Console, Visual Studio Code and GitHub throughout the development process.

Skills Developed
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development with React and Firebase, managing real-time data, handling cloud storage, ensuring secure user authentication and optimizing user interface design.
